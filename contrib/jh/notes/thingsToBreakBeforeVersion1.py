move things into more modules :

	gaffercore
		- paths, utilities

	gaffercoreui
		- totally generic widgets, path widgets

	gaffergraph
	gaffergraphui

	gaffercortex
	gaffercortexui

distinguish widgets and gadgets by module namespace?

rename borderwidth parameters to something more accurate
	- consider the ContainerGadget::padding naming too

have module name in typeName() ?

change serialisation to use parent().addChild(), and allow nested group nodes

rename CompoundObjectPlug to AtomicCompoundObjectPlug?
	- and ObjectVectorPlug to AtomicObjectVectorPlug?
		- or remove this one?
			- i'm not sure we really need it

rename all the user facing *Node things to simply *?
	- Scene, Image, Preferences, TimeWarp, etc...
	- this would mean renamign TimeWarp to TimeWarpBase

stop using button press signals for making menus
	- we've got contextmenusignal now

rename UndoContext to UndoScope and ParameterModificationContext to ParameterModificationScope ?
	- to avoid confusion with Context

remove **kw from Widget constructors? and have parentArgs instead?
